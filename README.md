## üè∑Ô∏è Discord Bio Template

> This is a fully static HTML/CSS site!

I've been working on this site as a form of bio for a friend of mine, talking to him, we've come to an agreement that I'll put the template here on Github for public use! So I hope you enjoy it. ü•∞

It's a site just a little bit similar to the Discord profile... Don't tell them üòÖ

### ‚ú® What is included?

This site is not just a bunch of HTML code with a little CSS, it is also:

- ‚úÖ A replica of the Discord profile!
  - A replica that is pretty hard to find here on Github.
- ‚úÖ Real-time Discord profile data using [Lanyard API](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard/). You need to join [Lanyard's Discord](https://discord.gg/z2xW3zxYdt) for your profile to work!
  - Automatically takes your username along with your Discord icon, using just your ID.
- ‚úÖ Simple setup!
  - You only need to fill in a few things for your website to look like you!
  - In `index.html` and in `config.js`

### üîß Getting Started

If you are interested in using this site, you need to know a few things!

- Download the source as a ZIP folder or clone it via `git` using the `git clone` command.
- Fill in the required spaces in these files below:
  - Index: `index.html`
  - Config: `config.js`
- The most important part is in `config.js`
  - **P.S.** You need to fill in everything right, especially your discord ID, for everything to work without any errors.

Remembering that you can use and abuse this site as you want, I'm posting it here especially for people who want a template like this, or people who don't know how to program and want to start somewhere. So, enjoy! ü•∞
